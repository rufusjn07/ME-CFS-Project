# ME-CFS-Project

# Overview

Medical centres and clinics collect abundant records on patients that can be applied to health and medical research challenges. This is certainly the case with CFS Discovery in Melbourne, who have collected detailed data on ME/CFS patients for almost 20 years. ME/CFS is a mysterious and controversial disease, where Australian scientists are making excellent progress via cross-disciplinary research.

Patient data is stored as individual records, and as such it is very time consuming to physically extract the data for spreadsheets and databases, required for machine-learning and other analyses.

The project is: To automate the extraction of valuable ME/CFS patient data into aggregated form (via spreadsheets is fine), accurately and efficiently. The successful completion of this challenge will accelerate our research efforts towards understanding ME/CFS, by contributing to the construction of anonymous patient databases for pattern recognition interrogation, as well as in support for future biobanks.

# Project Administration
Timeline
Week 2-3: Requirement gathering and technology assessment/exploration. 
Week 4-5: Iteration 1 & 2 – Work on Printed text conversion to digitalized documents.
Week 6-7: Iteration 3 & 4 – Work on Handwritten text conversion to digitalized documents.
Week 8-9: Full round of user acceptance testing and consolidation.
Week 10-12: Reflection and improvements.

# Milestone Chart  
Deliverables
•	Modular well-structured code to carry out the following:
o	New process to convert and store printed patient records into PDF and excel sheets. 
o	New Process to convert and store hand-written records/notes into PDF and excel sheets
o	Provide an easy to use and intuitive user interface. 
o	Allow sufficient space for scalability and further analytic needs. 

•	Documentation will be covered in the following:
o	Well commented and modular code. 
o	High level documentation on code process in each iteration. 
o	A user guide to be handed to the stakeholders at the end of the project.
2.3 Version control and monitoring.
All work will be tracked in github, and while the project deliverables on a high level will be constantly updated on the project wiki.
